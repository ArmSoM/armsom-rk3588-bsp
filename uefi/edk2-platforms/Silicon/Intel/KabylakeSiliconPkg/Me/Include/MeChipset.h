/** @file
  Chipset definition for ME Devices.

  Conventions:

  - Prefixes:
    - Definitions beginning with "R_" are registers
    - Definitions beginning with "B_" are bits within registers
    - Definitions beginning with "V_" are meaningful values of bits within the registers
    - Definitions beginning with "S_" are register sizes
    - Definitions beginning with "N_" are the bit position
  - In general, ME registers are denoted by "_ME_" in register names
  - Registers / bits that are different between PCH generations are denoted by
    "_ME_[generation_name]_" in register/bit names.
  - Registers / bits that are specific to PCH-H denoted by "PCH_H_" in register/bit names.
    Registers / bits that are specific to PCH-LP denoted by "PCH_LP_" in register/bit names.
    e.g., "_ME_PCH_H_", "_ME_PCH_LP_"
    Registers / bits names without _PCH_H_ or _PCH_LP_ apply for both H and LP.
  - Registers / bits that are different between SKUs are denoted by "_[SKU_name]"
    at the end of the register/bit names
  - Registers / bits of new devices introduced in a PCH generation will be just named
    as "_ME_" without [generation_name] inserted.
