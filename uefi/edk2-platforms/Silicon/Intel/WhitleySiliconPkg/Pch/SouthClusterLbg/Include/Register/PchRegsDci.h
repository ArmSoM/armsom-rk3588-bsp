  Register names for PCH DCI device
  Conventions:
  Prefixes:
  Definitions beginning with "R_" are registers
  Definitions beginning with "B_" are bits within registers
  Definitions beginning with "V_" are meaningful values within the bits
  Definitions beginning with "S_" are register sizes
  Definitions beginning with "N_" are the bit position
  In general, PCH registers are denoted by "_PCH_" in register names
  Registers / bits that are different between PCH generations are denoted by
  _PCH_[generation_name]_" in register/bit names.
  Registers / bits that are specific to PCH-H denoted by "_H_" in register/bit names.
  Registers / bits that are specific to PCH-LP denoted by "_LP_" in register/bit names.
  e.g., "_PCH_H_", "_PCH_LP_"
  Registers / bits names without _H_ or _LP_ apply for both H and LP.
  Registers / bits that are different between SKUs are denoted by "_[SKU_name]"
  at the end of the register/bit names
  Registers / bits of new devices introduced in a PCH generation will be just named
  as "_PCH_" without [generation_name] inserted.
