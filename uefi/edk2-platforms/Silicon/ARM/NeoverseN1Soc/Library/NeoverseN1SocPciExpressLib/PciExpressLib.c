  Functions in this library instance make use of MMIO functions in IoLib to
  access memory mapped PCI configuration space.

  All assertions for I/O operations are handled in MMIO functions in the IoLib
  Library.

  On the NeoverseN1Soc, a slave error is generated when host accesses the
  configuration space of non-available device or unimplemented function on a
  given bus. So this library introduces a workaround using IsBdfValid(),
  to return 0xFFFFFFFF for all such access.

  In addition to this, the hardware has two other limitations which affect
  access to the PCIe root port:
    1. ECAM space is not contiguous, root port ECAM (BDF = 0:0:0) is isolated
       from rest of the downstream hierarchy ECAM space.
    2. Root port ECAM space is not capable of 8bit/16bit writes.
  The description of the workarounds included for these limitations can
  be found in the comments below.

  Get the physical address of a configuration space register.

  points to a accessible BDF. If it is not accessible, return the address

  whether the specified address is for the root port and use a different base
