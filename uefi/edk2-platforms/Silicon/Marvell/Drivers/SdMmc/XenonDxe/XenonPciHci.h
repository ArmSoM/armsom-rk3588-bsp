  Read/Write specified SD/MMC host controller mmio register.

  @param[in]      PciIo        The PCI IO protocol instance.
  @param[in]      BarIndex     The BAR index of the standard PCI Configuration
                               header to use as the base address for the memory
                               operation to perform.
  @param[in]      Offset       The offset within the selected BAR to start the
                               memory operation.
  @param[in]      Read         A boolean to indicate it's read or write operation.
  @param[in]      Count        The width of the mmio register in bytes.
                               Must be 1, 2 , 4 or 8 bytes.
  @param[in, out] Data         For read operations, the destination buffer to store
                               the results. For write operations, the source buffer
                               to write data from. The caller is responsible for
                               having ownership of the data buffer and ensuring its
                               size not less than Count bytes.

  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER The PciIo or Data is NULL or the Count is not valid.
  @retval EFI_SUCCESS           The read/write operation succeeds.
  @retval Others                The read/write operation fails.
