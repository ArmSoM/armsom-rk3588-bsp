# **EDK II Minimum Platform Firmware User Interface Features**

This feature domain directory contains user interface related advanced features.

Features may be added to this domain whose primary role and responsibility is related to user interfaces. This may
include any number of interfaces related to user interaction with the system that require firmware support. High-level
examples of common user interfaces in firmware are console support and Human Interface Infrastructure (HII). These
high-level categories may comprise multiple independent features. It is recommended to reduce individual feature scope
to the minimally required level for the feature to be functional to improve cohesion within the feature package.
