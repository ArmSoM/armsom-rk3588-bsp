# **EDK II Minimum Platform Firmware Out-of-Band Management Advanced Features**

This feature domain directory contains out-of-band management related advanced features.

Features may be added to this domain whose primary role and responsibility is related to out-of-band management. These
are features that typically interface with an external controller to enable system maintenance operations such as
monitoring, logging, and recovery control functions independent of the main processors, host CPU firmware (BIOS), and
host operating system. An out-of-band controller is usually available when the system is in a powered down state.
