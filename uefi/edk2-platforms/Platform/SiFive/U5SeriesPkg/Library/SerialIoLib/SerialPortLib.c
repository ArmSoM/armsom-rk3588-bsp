  Sets the baud rate, receive FIFO depth, transmit/receice time out, parity,

                            serial interface. A ReceiveFifoDepth value of 0 will use
                            the device's default FIFO depth.

  @param Parity             The type of parity to use on this serial device. A Parity value of
                            DefaultParity will use the device's default parity value.

  @param DataBits           The number of data bits to use on the serial device. A DataBits
                            vaule of 0 will use the device's default data bit setting.
                            On output, the value actually set.
  @param StopBits           The number of stop bits to use on this serial device. A StopBits
                            value of DefaultStopBits will use the device's default number of
                            stop bits.
