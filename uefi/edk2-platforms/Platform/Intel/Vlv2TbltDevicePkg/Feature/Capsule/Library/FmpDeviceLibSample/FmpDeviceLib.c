/**
  Updates a firmware device with a new firmware image.  This function returns
  EFI_UNSUPPORTED if the firmware image is not updatable.  If the firmware image
  is updatable, the function should perform the following minimal validations
  before proceeding to do the firmware image update.
    - Validate that the image is a supported image for this firmware device.
      Return EFI_ABORTED if the image is not supported.  Additional details
      on why the image is not a supported image may be returned in AbortReason.
    - Validate the data from VendorCode if is not NULL.  Firmware image
      validation must be performed before VendorCode data validation.
      VendorCode data is ignored or considered invalid if image validation
      fails.  Return EFI_ABORTED if the VendorCode data is invalid.

  VendorCode enables vendor to implement vendor-specific firmware image update
  policy.  Null if the caller did not specify the policy or use the default
  policy.  As an example, vendor can implement a policy to allow an option to
  force a firmware image update when the abort reason is due to the new firmware
  image version is older than the current firmware image version or bad image
  checksum.  Sensitive operations such as those wiping the entire firmware image
  and render the device to be non-functional should be encoded in the image
  itself rather than passed with the VendorCode.  AbortReason enables vendor to
  have the option to provide a more detailed description of the abort reason to
  the caller.

  @param[in]  Image             Points to the new firmware image.
  @param[in]  ImageSize         Size, in bytes, of the new firmware image.
  @param[in]  VendorCode        This enables vendor to implement vendor-specific
                                firmware image update policy.  NULL indicates
                                the caller did not specify the policy or use the
                                default policy.
  @param[in]  Progress          A function used to report the progress of
                                updating the firmware device with the new
                                firmware image.
  @param[in]  CapsuleFwVersion  The version of the new firmware image from the
                                update capsule that provided the new firmware
                                image.
  @param[out] AbortReason       A pointer to a pointer to a Null-terminated
                                Unicode string providing more details on an
                                aborted operation. The buffer is allocated by
                                this function with
                                EFI_BOOT_SERVICES.AllocatePool().  It is the
                                caller's responsibility to free this buffer with
                                EFI_BOOT_SERVICES.FreePool().
  @param[out] LastAttemptStatus A pointer to a UINT32 that holds the last attempt
                                status to report back to the ESRT table in case
                                of error. This value will only be checked when this
                                function returns an error.

                                The return status code must fall in the range of
                                LAST_ATTEMPT_STATUS_DEVICE_LIBRARY_MIN_ERROR_CODE_VALUE to
                                LAST_ATTEMPT_STATUS_DEVICE_LIBRARY_MAX_ERROR_CODE_VALUE.

                                If the value falls outside this range, it will be converted
                                to LAST_ATTEMPT_STATUS_ERROR_UNSUCCESSFUL.

/**
  Checks if a new firmware image is valid for the firmware device.  This
  function allows firmware update operation to validate the firmware image
  before FmpDeviceSetImage() is called.

  @param[in]  Image               Points to a new firmware image.
  @param[in]  ImageSize           Size, in bytes, of a new firmware image.
  @param[out] ImageUpdatable      Indicates if a new firmware image is valid for
                                  a firmware update to the firmware device.  The
                                  following values from the Firmware Management
                                  Protocol are supported:
                                    IMAGE_UPDATABLE_VALID
                                    IMAGE_UPDATABLE_INVALID

                                    IMAGE_UPDATABLE_VALID_WITH_VENDOR_CODE
  @param[out] LastAttemptStatus   A pointer to a UINT32 that holds the last attempt
                                  status to report back to the ESRT table in case
                                  of error. This value will only be checked when this
                                  function returns an error.

                                  The return status code must fall in the range of
                                  LAST_ATTEMPT_STATUS_DEVICE_LIBRARY_MIN_ERROR_CODE_VALUE to
                                  LAST_ATTEMPT_STATUS_DEVICE_LIBRARY_MAX_ERROR_CODE_VALUE.

                                  If the value falls outside this range, it will be converted
                                  to LAST_ATTEMPT_STATUS_ERROR_UNSUCCESSFUL.
