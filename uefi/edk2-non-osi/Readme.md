This branch holds modules not compatible with the normal
[edk2](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2) and
[edk2-platforms](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-platforms)
licensing requirements, and any associated files.

As such, this repository has no top-level License.txt, and each module (or
group of modules) must provide their own License.txt. Where any conflict exists,
the License.txt nearest to the module in simple hierarchy takes precedence.
That is, `Vendor/Module/License.txt` would take precedence over
`Vendor/License.txt` for `Vendor/Module/Module.efi`.
