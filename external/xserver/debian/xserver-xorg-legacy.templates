Template: xserver-xorg-legacy/xwrapper/allowed_users
Type: select
__Choices: Root Only, Console Users Only, Anybody
Default: Console Users Only
_Description: Users allowed to start the X server:
 Because the X server runs with superuser privileges, it may be unwise to
 permit any user to start it, for security reasons.  On the other hand, it is
 even more unwise to run general-purpose X client programs as root, which is
 what may happen if only root is permitted to start the X server.  A good
 compromise is to permit the X server to be started only by users logged in to
 one of the virtual consoles.
