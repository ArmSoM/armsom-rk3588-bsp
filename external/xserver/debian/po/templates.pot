"Because the X server runs with superuser privileges, it may be unwise to "
"permit any user to start it, for security reasons.  On the other hand, it is "
"even more unwise to run general-purpose X client programs as root, which is "
"what may happen if only root is permitted to start the X server.  A good "
"compromise is to permit the X server to be started only by users logged in "
"to one of the virtual consoles."
